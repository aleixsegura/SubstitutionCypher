It's about cyphering with substitution. We have two alphabets one for the characters of our text and the other
for cyphering our clear text.

char[][] key = new char[][]{{‘a’, ‘*’},
                            {‘g’, ‘%’},
                            {‘i’, ‘#’}};
In this case, the word agiiga cyphered would be: "*%##%*"
